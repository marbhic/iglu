\title{Calculate eA1C}
\usage{
ea1c(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{DataFrame object with column names "id", "time", and "gl",
or numeric vector of glucose values.}
}
\value{
If a data.frame object is passed, then a tibble object with
two columns: subject id and corresponding eA1C is returned. If a vector of glucose
values is passed, then a tibble object with just the eA1C value is returned.
as.numeric() can be wrapped around the latter to output just a numeric value.
}
\description{
The function ea1c produces eA1C values in a tibble object.
}
\details{
A tibble object with 1 row for each subject, a column for subject id and
a column for eA1C values is returned. NA glucose values are
omitted from the calculation of the eA1C.

eA1C score is calculated by \eqn{(46.7+mean(BG))/28.7}
where BG is the vector of Blood Glucose Measurements (mg/dL).
